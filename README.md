# ExpressApp

# req1

I created authRouter for users to make POST requests to either sign up or sign in. When a registered user successfully signs in, a JWT generated by jsonwebtoken library will be returned to the client. In order to create a post, a valid JWT is required and a middleware function verifyToken will be triggered whenever a request is passed to postsRouter. Also, I use multer and aws-sdk library to upload each photo to AWS S3. Then, the image file will be validated by a uploadErrorHandler function before a Post data object is created in Postgre instance of AWS RDS. The url to the photo will be stored as attribute of Post data object. To update schema of tables in PostgreSQL, I used Sequelize cli to control the database.

# req2

In order to add the feature of having at most 5 photos, I created another data table called Photo in the database. It has 5 attributes which are id(integer), postId(integer), photoUrl(string), createdAt(timestamp with timezone in iso format), and updatedAt(timestamp with timezone in iso format). In addition, I increase the limit of multer to 5. On the other hand, I created a route which has a userId as parameter to edit any posts asociate with this userId. The route will return a list of json objects where each of them represents a Post object associates with the given userId. Each Post Object has id, title, description, userId, timeDiff(difference between now and the time when the post was created), and a list of photo urls. This returning data is designed to be viewed by the user with the given userId so that the user can edit the content in the front end.

All API calls are tested in Postman.
