I created authRouter for users to make POST requests to either sign up or sign in. When a registered user successfully signs in, a JWT generated by jsonwebtoken library will be returned to the client. In order to create a post, a valid JWT is required and a middleware function verifyToken will be triggered whenever a request is passed to postsRouter. Also, I use multer and aws-sdk library to upload each photo to AWS S3. Then, the image file will be validated by a uploadErrorHandler function before a Post data object is created in Postgre instance of AWS RDS. The url to the photo will be stored as attribute of Post data object. To update schema of tables in PostgreSQL, I used Sequelize cli to control the database.
